# Principal Component Analysis of Educational Institutions

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about various colleges and universities. The primary focus is to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover significant patterns and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The dataset is titled Education-Post 12th Grade.csv, and the data dictionary for this dataset can be found in the Data Dictionary.xlsx file.

# Table of Contents
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Business Implications of PCA

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis 
# Univariate Analysis

* Distribution Analysis: Charts depicting the distribution of various features such as the number of faculties with PhDs, number of applications accepted, number of applications received, graduation rate, and new student enrollments.

* Key Insights:
High acceptance rate inferred from comparing the number of applications received and accepted.
Graduation rates and new enrollments provide insights into the performance and popularity of institutions.

* Example Plots
